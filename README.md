# Twitter Ad Blocker

A simple Chrome extension to block promoted tweets on Twitter. This extension was created with the help of [OpenAI's ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the code as a ZIP file.
2. Open Google Chrome, navigate to `chrome://extensions/`, and enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner.
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder containing the extension files (either the cloned repository or the unzipped folder).

Now the extension is installed and should block promoted tweets on Twitter.

## Usage

The extension will automatically block promoted tweets as you browse Twitter. It checks for new promoted tweets periodically, so it may not work perfectly with Twitter's infinite scroll feature. Additionally, the extension may stop working if Twitter changes the structure of its HTML, so it's essential to keep the extension updated.
